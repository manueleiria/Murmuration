# Murmuration
### A WebVR Flocking Simulation

This project is part of an art installation titled Murmuration. 
It is heavily based on [Mr.doob](http://mrdoob.com/)'s three.js webgl_gpgpu_birds example, as well as [Gene Kogan](http://genekogan.com/)'s Processing 1.5 FlockingBoids model geometry.

Both can be found at:
